# Golden Hour Wedding Scheduler #
Create the ideal wedding day schedule by prioritizing golden hour and dynamically generating a color-coded schedule. When the user enters the date of the event, the ceremony location, the photo shoot location, and the reception destination, the app calculates and displays: 

* The travel time from the ceremony to the photo shoot location;
* Golden hour; and
* The travel time from the photo shoot location to the reception location. 

## Motivation ##

Wedding industry professionals trying to craft the perfect wedding day schedule will find this app useful because it automates the calculation of golden hour, and the travel time to get to the photo shoot location. The rest of the day's events can be scheduled around golden hour. 

## Description ##

The app uses the following APIs:
* [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete). This API autocompletes the user-entered location on the submission form.
* The [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) obtains the longitude and latitude of the photo shoot location. 
* [Sunrise-Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) uses the latitude and longitude generated by the open weather API to return the sunset time. Golden hour is calculated from one hour before the sun sets, and ends at sunset.  
* [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start) is called for the travel time between the ceremony location, photo shoot location, and reception location.
